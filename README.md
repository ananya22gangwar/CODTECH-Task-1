Overview of the Project

Objective :
Develop an ML model to predict stock market trends by analyzing historical data, improving accuracy in investment decision-making.

Key Activities:
Historical Data Analysis: Utilizes past stock prices, volume, and trends to identify patterns.
Technical Indicators: Incorporates moving averages, RSI, MACD, and other indicators for enhanced prediction accuracy.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyzes news, social media, and financial reports to gauge market sentiment.

Technologies Used:
Python: Programming language widely used for developing ML models.
TensorFlow: Open-source library for building and training neural networks.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library, useful for handling time series data.
NumPy: Library for numerical computation, essential for data processing.

Key Insights:
Historical Patterns Matter: Stock prices often follow historical patterns that machine learning models can detect and leverage for predictions.
Data Quality is Crucial: The accuracy of predictions heavily depends on the quality and granularity of input data, including financial metrics and market indicators.
